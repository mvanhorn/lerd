# Dashboard themes

The dashboard ships twelve themes and takes as many of your own as you care to
write. A theme is independent of light/dark: you pick the mode in the icon rail,
and the theme in **System → lerd → Theme**.

The theme is stored in `~/.config/lerd/config.yaml` under `ui.theme`, so every
device that opens the dashboard shows the same lerd, a phone on the LAN included.
Switching it on one device repaints the others straight away, over the socket
they already hold open, with no reload. The light/dark mode stays per browser,
since that follows the room you are sitting in rather than the install.

## Built-in themes

| Theme | Accent | Background (dark mode) |
|---|---|---|
| `lerd` | the bright brand red | `#0d0d0d` |
| Breeze | Plasma blue | `#141618` |
| Adwaita | Adwaita blue | `#1d1d20` |
| macOS | the system blue | `#1e1e1e` |
| `muted` | a desaturated brick | `#111113` |
| Ocean | a calm steel blue | `#0d1418` |
| Solarized Dark | Solarized blue | `#002b36` |
| Monokai | Monokai pink | `#272822` |
| Cobalt | Cobalt orange | `#193549` |
| Dracula | Dracula purple | `#282a36` |
| Nord | Nord frost | `#2e3440` |
| Gruvbox Dark | Gruvbox orange | `#282828` |

`lerd` is the default. `muted` is there for anyone who finds the default red too
sharp, especially on a bright screen.

The desktop themes are taken from what those desktops ship today, not from the
values most write-ups still quote: Breeze from Plasma 6.7's `BreezeDark.colors`,
Adwaita from libadwaita 1.9's named colours, macOS from Apple's documented system
blue and window background. All three have been darkened over the years.

Each theme carries a light tone and a dark tone for its accent, so switching
between light and dark keeps the colour readable on whichever surface the mode
paints. The editor and desktop schemes are dark schemes: their backgrounds apply
in dark mode, and in light mode you get their accent on the usual white.

## Writing your own

Drop a YAML file into `~/.config/lerd/themes/`. The file name is the theme's id,
so `lagoon.yaml` becomes the theme `lagoon`. Only `name` and `accent` are
required; every other tone is derived from the accent, and the surfaces fall
back to the built-in ones.

```yaml
name: Lagoon
accent: "#3b7ea1"
```

The full set of fields:

```yaml
name: Lagoon                # what the picker shows
accent: "#3b7ea1"           # buttons, active tabs, links, focus rings (light mode)
accent_hover: "#336b8a"     # the accent's hover tone (light mode)
accent_dark: "#7fb6d4"      # the accent in dark mode
accent_hover_dark: "#93c2dc"# its hover tone in dark mode
bg: "#0c1114"               # page background, dark mode
card: "#141b1f"             # card background, dark mode
border: "#222c32"           # card and divider borders, dark mode
muted: "#3c4a52"            # dim text and inactive marks, dark mode
```

Every value must be a plain hex colour, `#rgb` or `#rrggbb`. CSS colour names
(`rebeccapurple`) and functional notations (`rgb()`, `oklch()`) are refused: the
value is handed to the browser as a custom property, and only a literal colour
may come out of a file and decide how the page paints. The four surface fields
apply to dark mode only, where light mode draws on white and the standard greys.

A file named after a built-in replaces it rather than appearing twice, so you can
keep the name and change the colours.

Reload the dashboard and the theme appears in the picker. A file with a mistake
in it is listed under the picker with the reason, rather than quietly missing.

## Importing

**System → lerd → Import theme** takes a file or pasted YAML and writes it into
`~/.config/lerd/themes/` for you, then selects it. The trash icon beside a theme
asks before it deletes the file.

## Following the desktop theme

On Omarchy, KDE Plasma, GNOME and macOS, the desktop's own colours show up in the
picker as one more entry: `Omarchy (tokyo-night)` names the theme the desktop is
on, and elsewhere the entry is the familiar `Breeze`, `Adwaita` or `macOS`, wearing
whatever the desktop is actually set to rather than a fixed copy of it. Pick it once
and lerd follows the desktop from then on: change the theme or the accent and
every open dashboard repaints, including the embedded service views. A theme you
chose deliberately is never overridden, and on a machine with no desktop to read
the entry is simply absent. There is one entry at most, and no trash icon beside
it: the desktop is the source, so the entry goes away when the desktop does.

On a fresh install the offer is one of the **Get started with Lerd** steps. An
install that never went through Get started and has never had a theme chosen gets
a banner offering the desktop's entry instead, with one button to switch to it and
one to keep the current theme. lerd never switches on its own. Either answer is written to the config like any other
pick, so the banner shows up once per install, not once per browser, and it never
comes back after a theme has been chosen.

**Omarchy** publishes everything in the active theme's `colors.toml`, which every
theme it ships carries. A dark desktop theme lends its accent and its surfaces; a
light one lends only its accent, because the surface fields are the dark ones and
a pale background would land behind type coloured to sit on a dark card. The
watch sits on `~/.local/state/omarchy/current`, which is where
`omarchy-theme-set` moves the new theme into place.

**Plasma** keeps the accent and a copy of the active colour scheme in
`~/.config/kdeglobals`, so the entry carries surfaces too: the view background,
the window background and its alternate become the page, the cards and their
borders. Whether the scheme counts as dark is read off the window background
rather than the scheme's name. A light scheme lends one tone instead, the window
background it tints its own chrome with, which the dashboard puts behind the rail
and the sidebar in light mode. A stock Plasma that never had an accent picked
lends the scheme's selection colour instead.

The chrome also follows focus the way Plasma's own windows do. Breeze draws a
focused window's header in its own tone and an unfocused one in the window
colour, and the scheme's `[Colors:Header]` group says what that focused tone is.
While the dashboard window has focus the rail and the page headers take it, in
dark and light mode alike, and they drop back to the window colour as soon as
focus moves to another window. The sidebar between them holds still. A scheme
without a header group, as schemes from before Plasma 6 are, keeps a single tone.

**GNOME** publishes the accent alone, one of the ten libadwaita colours, read
from `org.gnome.desktop.interface accent-color`. That is all it lends, since the
desktop's surfaces are not something you picked; the Adwaita entry keeps the
surfaces it always had and only its accent follows the desktop. Ubuntu paints
each accent in its own Yaru tone rather than libadwaita's, so under a Yaru GTK
theme the dashboard takes the Yaru tone, the olive green or Ubuntu orange the
rest of the desktop is wearing. GNOME 46 and older have no accent setting, so
there is nothing to follow there.

**macOS** publishes the accent alone as well, the one picked in System Settings
under Appearance, read from `AppleAccentColor` in the global preferences domain.
The eight swatches map onto Apple's own hexes and multicolor, which is what an
account that never touched the picker is on, follows the system blue. The macOS
entry keeps the surfaces it always had, and the watch sits on
`~/Library/Preferences`, so a change shows up once macOS flushes the domain to
disk rather than the instant the swatch is clicked.

Light mode tints the rail and the sidebar rather than leaving them white on the
three desktop palettes, Breeze, Adwaita and macOS, since those are the desktops
that tint their own chrome; the tone is Breeze's window colour, libadwaita's
sidebar colour and the grey a Mac uses. A live Plasma entry on a light scheme
publishes its own instead, and the installed app's title bar follows whatever the
rail is wearing. The editor schemes and lerd's own themes keep the white rail.

The entry has to be the desktop in front of you, not a file left behind by an
application. `kdeglobals` exists on any machine that has ever run a Qt app, and
the GNOME schemas ship with half the desktop packages out there, so a desktop
counts when `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` says so, or when the accent is one you actually
recorded in that desktop's own settings. Picking up a live change needs the watch
that was set when `lerd-ui` started, so if you install a desktop or set an accent
for the first time, `lerd restart` once.

On Plasma, GNOME and macOS the desktop entry takes the place of the built-in that
imitates it, Breeze, Adwaita and macOS, rather than sitting beside it: the built-in is a
snapshot of one scheme, and the machine in front of you has the real one, on
whichever scheme it is currently wearing. It keeps that built-in's name, so the
picker still offers Breeze, Adwaita and macOS, and picking one now follows the
desktop. A
dashboard already set to either starts following it too, and any tone the desktop
does not publish comes from the built-in it replaced, which is where the GNOME
entry gets its surfaces.

A theme file named `omarchy.yaml`, `breeze.yaml`, `adwaita.yaml` or `macos.yaml`
is shadowed by the desktop entry rather than replacing it: picking the entry named after a
desktop has to give you that desktop's colours.

## Installed as an app

Installed from the browser, the window and the launch splash are painted by the
browser rather than by the page. The title bar wears what the sidebar wears, the
card surface in dark mode and white in light, so the frame carries on into the
app instead of banding the accent across the top of it. It follows the theme as
soon as you switch, and the manifest carries the current tones so the app you
install matches what you were looking at. The manifest is read once at install,
so a theme switch afterwards reaches the splash only when the browser next
refreshes it.

## Asking an assistant for one

There is no MCP tool for this, deliberately: a theme is a personal choice, and
nothing should be able to repaint your dashboard without you. The file is the
interface instead. An assistant with access to your files can write a theme into
`~/.config/lerd/themes/` the same way it writes any other file, when you ask it
to and not otherwise. Point it at the schema above and reload the dashboard.
