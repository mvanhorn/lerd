# AI Integration (MCP)

Lerd ships a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, letting AI assistants manage your dev environment directly: run migrations, start services, toggle queue workers, and inspect logs without leaving the chat.

Supported assistants: **Claude Code, Cursor, JetBrains Junie, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot (VS Code), Google Antigravity, OpenCode, Windsurf**, and any other MCP-compatible tool.

---

## Setting up MCP

There are two ways to connect lerd to your AI assistant: globally (recommended) or per-project.

### Global registration (recommended)

Run once after installing lerd:

```bash
lerd mcp:enable-global
```

Or turn on **AI assistants (MCP)** under System in the [web UI](./web-ui.md#system), which does the same and turns it off again with `lerd mcp:disable-global`'s teardown.

This registers the lerd MCP server at **user scope**, available in every session regardless of which directory you open, and writes user-scope context files so the assistant knows what lerd tools are available and how to use them.

MCP server registration:

| Client | Registration |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude mcp add --scope user` (CLI) |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |
| JetBrains Junie | `~/.junie/mcp/mcp.json` |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/settings.json` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/config.toml` |
| GitHub Copilot (VS Code) | `~/.config/Code/User/mcp.json` |
| Google Antigravity | `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` |

Context / instructions files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.claude/skills/lerd/SKILL.md` | Claude Code user-scope skill |
| `~/.cursor/rules/lerd.mdc` | Cursor user-scope rules |
| `~/.junie/guidelines.md` | JetBrains Junie user-scope guidelines (merged, not overwritten) |
| `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` | Gemini CLI user-scope context (merged) |
| `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` | Codex CLI user-scope context (merged) |
| `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` | OpenCode user-scope context (merged) |

All clients share a single canonical tool reference, so the guidance never drifts between assistants. When running globally, the server uses the **directory the assistant is opened in** as the site context: no further configuration is needed.

> **Claude Code** is registered via its own `claude mcp add` CLI rather than by editing `~/.claude.json` directly, since that file holds all of Claude's user state.

> **GitHub Copilot** uses VS Code's `servers` key (each entry typed `stdio`), which differs from the `mcpServers` key the other clients use. Its instructions file (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) is project-scoped only.

> **Google Antigravity** registers at `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` (its project-scoped MCP config is not honoured, so it is global only). It auto-loads `GEMINI.md` and `AGENTS.md`, which the Gemini and Codex entries already write, so no separate Antigravity context file is needed.

> **OpenCode** uses neither of the other two shapes: its entry sits under an `mcp` key, is typed `local` rather than `stdio`, and takes the whole invocation as a single `command` array. It reads `AGENTS.md` from the project root, which the Codex entry already writes, so only its own `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` is written separately. OpenCode also reads `opencode.jsonc`, and its own documentation asks for one format per directory, so where a `.jsonc` already exists lerd merges into that file rather than leaving a `.json` beside it that may never be read. The rewrite emits plain JSON, so comments in that file are not preserved.

> **During `lerd install`:** If Claude Code is detected, you'll be prompted to run this automatically.

> **During `lerd update`:** When MCP is globally registered, the context files that already exist are rewritten from the newly installed binary so they stay in sync with any added or renamed tools. Update never creates files for a client you haven't set up, to pick up a newly supported assistant, re-run `lerd mcp:enable-global`.

### Project-scoped registration

To commit the lerd MCP config into a project so every teammate picks it up from git:

```bash
cd ~/Lerd/my-app
lerd mcp:inject
```

This writes MCP config and context files for every supported client into the project directory:

| File | Client |
|---|---|
| `.mcp.json` | Claude Code MCP config |
| `.claude/skills/lerd/SKILL.md` | Claude Code skill |
| `.cursor/mcp.json` | Cursor MCP config |
| `.cursor/rules/lerd.mdc` | Cursor rules |
| `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` | JetBrains Junie MCP config |
| `.junie/guidelines.md` | JetBrains Junie guidelines (merged) |
| `.gemini/settings.json` | Gemini CLI MCP config |
| `GEMINI.md` | Gemini CLI context (merged) |
| `.vscode/mcp.json` | GitHub Copilot (VS Code) MCP config |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot instructions (merged) |
| `AGENTS.md` | Codex CLI context, also read by OpenCode (merged) |
| `opencode.json` | OpenCode MCP config |

The written entries carry no machine-specific data: the server resolves the site from the directory the assistant is opened in, exactly like a global registration. A committed `.mcp.json` therefore stays identical across every teammate's checkout, with no absolute path to drift or break on another machine. (An older lerd wrote a `LERD_SITE_PATH` absolute path into these files; it is still honoured if you set it by hand, but no longer written.)

> **Codex and Windsurf** have no project-scoped MCP config (Codex reads only `~/.codex/config.toml`, Windsurf only `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`), so `mcp:inject` writes their context but not a per-project server entry. Register them once with `lerd mcp:enable-global`. lerd used to write a Windsurf entry into `.ai/mcp/mcp.json`, but that path was never Windsurf's (it belongs to Laravel Boost), so lerd no longer touches it and strips any entry an older version left behind.

The command **merges** into existing configs; other MCP servers (e.g. `laravel-boost`, `herd`) and any existing instructions content are left untouched. Re-running it is safe.

To target a different directory:

```bash
lerd mcp:inject --path ~/Lerd/another-app
```

To reverse an injection, `lerd mcp:eject` (with an optional `--path`) strips every lerd-owned entry and skill file back out of the project, leaving other MCP servers and your own instructions content intact. The user-scope equivalent is `lerd mcp:disable-global`.

> **During `lerd update`:** Projects that previously ran `mcp:inject` are detected automatically (by the presence of `.claude/skills/lerd/SKILL.md`, `.cursor/rules/lerd.mdc`, or the lerd marker in `.junie/guidelines.md`) and refreshed in place. Only files that already exist for a client are rewritten, so update never drops new client files into your repo; re-run `mcp:inject` to add a newly supported assistant. Directories whose content already matches the new binary stay untouched, so git status stays clean. Projects that never opted in are skipped.

To opt a project out of this automatic refresh entirely, set `mcp_inject: false` in its `.lerd.yaml`. lerd then never rewrites that project's MCP config or skill files on a self-update, which is the right choice when you keep those files under version control and want them changed only when you say so. An explicit `lerd mcp:inject` still writes when you run it, since that is you asking directly.

### Path resolution

Most actions accept an optional `path` argument. When omitted, the server resolves it in this order:

1. Explicit `path` argument (highest priority)
2. `LERD_SITE_PATH` env var (honoured if set by hand; lerd no longer writes it)
3. Current working directory, the directory the assistant was opened in

### Agent detection passthrough

PHP runs inside the container, so the AI agent environment variables your coding agent exports on the host (`CLAUDECODE`, `AI_AGENT`, `CURSOR_AGENT`, `GEMINI_CLI`, and the rest of the [agent-detector](https://github.com/laravel/agent-detector) set) would normally be lost at the container boundary. lerd forwards any that are present into the container for `lerd php`, `lerd artisan`, and tinker, so packages like [laravel/pao](https://github.com/laravel/pao) still detect the agent and emit their compact JSON output.

Commands the `exec` MCP tool runs (`artisan`, `composer`, `vendor_run` for Pest/PHPUnit) go a step further: because reaching them through the MCP server proves an agent is driving the command, lerd injects a neutral `AI_AGENT=lerd-mcp` marker when no real agent variable is present. Pao therefore returns JSON for MCP-originated test runs even if the host environment carries nothing, while a real agent variable is still forwarded as-is when it exists. Manual terminal runs are never given the marker, so their output is unchanged.

### Running your framework's own MCP server

This is separate from lerd's MCP server. Some frameworks ship their own local MCP server, started as a console command — Laravel MCP does, and it is what [Laravel Boost](https://github.com/laravel/boost) builds on. Such a server has to run where the application runs: started from the host it resolves `lerd-mysql` or `lerd-redis` against nothing, and you end up maintaining a second set of host-only `.env` values just to keep it alive.

lerd's `php` shim already takes care of that. The installer puts lerd's bin directory ahead of the system one on your PATH, and the `php` there execs into the project's container, so the ordinary registration works unchanged:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
      "command": "php",
      "args": ["artisan", "mcp:start", "weather"]
    }
  }
}
```

The server then runs on the same PHP build, the same extensions and the same container network as the site, and the hostnames in your `.env` resolve exactly as they do for a web request.

A client you launch from a desktop icon rather than a terminal may not inherit your login PATH, in which case it finds the system `php` instead of the shim. Name lerd explicitly there:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
      "command": "lerd",
      "args": ["artisan", "mcp:start", "weather"]
    }
  }
}
```

Either form leaves stdout to the server: anything lerd needs to say while starting a container or a service goes to stderr, so it never lands in the middle of the JSON-RPC stream.

## Available MCP tools

The MCP surface is **twelve grouped tools**, each driven by an `action` argument. Always pass `action`; start by calling `site` with `action: "list"` to discover sites.

The server also sends short instructions when a client connects, telling the assistant to use these tools rather than the raw commands they wrap. Clients such as Claude Code load tool schemas only when needed, so without those instructions an assistant would see just a tool named `worktree` and run `git worktree add` itself, skipping the dependency install, branch domain and database isolation that `add` handles.

| Tool | Actions |
|---|---|
| `site` | `list` (discover sites, call first), `link`, `unlink`, `domain_add`, `domain_remove`, `group_assign`, `group_unassign`, `group_label`, `group_db`, `group_list`, `tls_enable`, `tls_disable`, `tls_renew`, `php`, `node`, `pause`, `unpause`, `restart`, `rebuild`, `runtime`, `nginx_read`, `nginx_write`, `nginx_reset`, `park`, `unpark` |
| `service` | `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `pin`, `unpin`, `update`, `rollback`, `migrate`, `remove`, `reinstall`, `add`, `expose`, `port`, `env`, `config_read`, `config_write`, `config_restore`, `config_reset`, `config_list_backups`, `preset_list`, `preset_search`, `preset_install`, `check_updates`, `entities`, `entity_action` |
| `db` | `list`, `set`, `move`, `create`, `export`, `import`, `snapshot`, `snapshots`, `restore`, `snapshot_delete`, `snapshot_keep`, `auto`, `auto_set`, `extension_list`, `extension_add` |
| `env` | `setup`, `check`, `override` |
| `runtime` | `versions`, `node_install`, `node_uninstall`, `node_manager`, `php_list`, `ext_list`, `ext_add`, `ext_remove`, `ports_list`, `ports_add`, `ports_remove`, `ini_read`, `ini_write`, `ini_reset` |
| `worker` | `list` (call first), `start`, `stop`, `add`, `remove`, `health`, `heal`, `mode_get`, `mode_set`, `queue_start`, `queue_stop`, `horizon_start`, `horizon_stop`, `reverb_start`, `reverb_stop`, `schedule_start`, `schedule_stop`, `stripe_start`, `stripe_stop`, `stripe_config` |
| `exec` | `artisan`, `console`, `composer`, `vendor_bins`, `vendor_run`, `commands_list`, `commands_run`, `command_add`, `command_remove` |
| `framework` | `list`, `add`, `remove`, `prune`, `search`, `update`, `project_new`, `setup` |
| `diag` | `status`, `doctor`, `doctor_fix`, `site_doctor`, `which`, `check`, `dns_diagnose`, `bug_report`, `analyze_queries`, `route_timing`, `optimize_route`, `dumps_recent`, `dumps_status`, `dumps_clear`, `dumps_toggle`, `profiler_toggle`, `profiler_status`, `profiler_clear`, `profiler_report`, `xdebug_on`, `xdebug_off`, `xdebug_status` |
| `logs` | `sources`, `fetch` |
| `worktree` | `list`, `add`, `remove`, `wait`, `db_isolate`, `db_share` |
| `workspace` | `list`, `create`, `rename`, `delete`, `assign`, `move` |

The injected context files document each action's arguments and the key conventions in full.

### Creating a worktree from an assistant

`worktree add` blocks until the watcher's setup pipeline has finished and reports `provisioned: true`, because the pipeline starts the moment git writes the worktree entry, and an action that returned earlier would hand back a tree being written underneath the assistant. Two installers in one tree is how `vendor/` ends up with packages extracted but no `autoload.php`, which then presents as a Composer autoload bug rather than a race.

Once dependencies are in, `add` finishes the worktree the way the dashboard's Add worktree form does: it builds the frontend assets (or starts the asset worker that replaces the build), wires the database, and runs any setup commands the framework definition declares, then reports `ready: true`. `build` (`auto`, `skip`, `worker:<name>`, `script:<name>`) and `db` (`share`, `empty`, `clone-main`, `clone-<branch>`) override the defaults, which are the automatic build pick and the parent's database; a framework that requires an isolated database gets one either way. When `db` is left out and the framework definition declares where its migrations live, `add` makes that choice itself by comparing the two checkouts' migration files, and reports it on a `Database:` line in `setup_output`. For a framework that declares no migrations folder, the server's instructions tell the assistant to choose `db` by comparing the new branch's migrations with the parent checkout's, meaning whichever branch the site's own folder has checked out, since that is the database sharing reuses and cloning copies, not necessarily git's `main`. Migrations only the new branch has call for a clone with those migrations run on it, migrations only the parent has mean the branch is behind (merge, or start from an empty database and migrate), and an identical set can share the parent's database. An `empty` database is migrated as part of `add`, using the migrate command the framework definition names. To start a new branch from another ref, pass `branch` with `base` (for example `base: origin/main`); `git_args` is for anything else and cannot be combined with `branch`.

`wait` is the same check on its own, for a worktree created with plain git or after `add` with `wait=false`. Both accept `timeout_seconds` (default 300) and report `provisioned: false` with a note rather than an error when setup is still running, since an unfinished install is a "not yet", not a failure.

An assistant should never infer readiness from the tree's contents. `node_modules/` exists from the first extracted package, and composer's extraction phase fills *existing* `vendor/<org>/` directories, so neither a file count nor an mtime moves during the longest stretch of an install. Both read as finished mid-install.

### Workspaces are not site groups

The two are easy to confuse and an assistant reaching for the wrong one does the wrong thing.

A **workspace** (the `workspace` tool) is a display-only bucket that organises the site list in the dashboard sidebar and the TUI. It never touches nginx, domains, certificates or `.env`. Use it when someone wants their sites sorted by client or by project.

A **site group** (the `site` tool's `group_*` actions) nests a real site under another site's subdomain, at `<label>.<main>.test`, and regenerates vhosts and certificates to serve it. Use it when a site should actually be reachable at that address.

### Service presets carry their own discovery metadata

`preset_list` returns each preset's `category`, `icon` and `admin_for`. `admin_for` names the services a preset's admin UI administers, and it is **not** `depends_on`: phpMyAdmin depends on mysql (satisfied by MariaDB via `env_role`) but administers both, and RedisInsight depends on redis (satisfied by Valkey) while administering both. To answer "which dashboard administers this database", read `admin_for`.

`service` start/stop/restart use the same `serviceops` path as the CLI, Web UI, and TUI: `depends_on` resolution (including family / `env_role` drop-ins), reverse-dependent start, soft stop cascade, and `discover_family` / pinned-dependency-host consumer regen. Stop failures surface as errors rather than a silent OK. Do not assume MCP is a thinner StartUnit wrapper.

### Downloads are disclosed, not started

An assistant is not the one paying for the bandwidth, so the actions that have to fetch a container image (`service` `preset_install`, `update`, `migrate`, `rollback`, `reinstall`, and `runtime` `ext_add`, which rebuilds a PHP image) answer with what they would download instead of downloading it. The answer names the image and its size, read from the registry manifest without pulling anything, and nothing has been fetched at that point. Repeating the call with `confirm: true` goes ahead. An image already in the local store is never disclosed, so the usual case runs straight through. This is the disclosure half of what `LERD_OFFLINE=1` does for the refusal half; see [Image downloads](../usage/lifecycle.md#image-downloads).

### Worker tuning comes from the framework definition

`worker` `list` reports each worker's tunable `options`: the placeholders its framework definition declares in `tune_command`, the default the definition runs for each, and whatever the project committed to `.lerd.yaml`. `start` (and `queue_start`) take them back as `options: ["queue=emails", "tries=5"]`. Nothing is named in the tool's own schema, so a store definition that makes another worker tunable reaches an assistant within the day, the same way the CLI grows a flag per placeholder. See [Worker options](../usage/queue-workers.md#worker-options).

### Reading logs

The `logs` tool lets an assistant debug a site's logs without opening files by hand. Call `logs` with `action: "sources"` to list every queryable source for a site (`app:<file>` framework logs, `fpm`, `worker:<name>`) plus shared infrastructure (`nginx`, `dns`, `watcher`, `ui`, services, `php<ver>`), then `action: "fetch"` with a `source` and any of `grep` (regex or literal substring), `since`/`until` (relative like `15m`/`2h30m`, or a timestamp), `level` (app logs only), and `lines`. Each `fetch` returns an opaque `cursor`; pass it back as `since` on the next call to receive only the new lines, which is how streaming is modelled over MCP's request/response transport. See [the logs feature page](logs.md) for the full source list, filter semantics, and platform notes.

> **Grouped surface:** earlier lerd versions exposed ~80 individual MCP tools (`sites`, `artisan`, `db_set`, …). These were consolidated into the grouped tools above to cut the per-session token cost and sharpen the model's tool selection. Old flat tool names no longer exist; call the group with the matching `action` instead (e.g. `artisan` → `exec` with `action: "artisan"`, `db_set` → `db` with `action: "set"`).

## Example interactions

The `path` argument is omitted from most calls; the server resolves it from the directory the assistant was opened in.
